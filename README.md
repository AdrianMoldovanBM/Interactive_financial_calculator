# ROI-Win_rate-Risk_ratio_calculator

Coding in Python and using Google Colab, I developed an interactive financial calculator for businesses and people alike, that helps users calculate three key financial metrics: **ROI (Return on Investment)**, **win rate**, and **risk ratio**. 
The program asks the user to choose one of these three options and then guides them through inputting the necessary values to perform the selected calculation.
